            <p>The recent chess world cup lasting almost a month - 30 July to 24 August - Was one of a lot of plot twists. From the young indian prodigies to Magnus's first
                win, This world cup has a lot to unpack. As usual, the top three finishers qualify for the candidates tournament, but this time was a bit unusual, with magnus placing first.

                It was the 10th edition of the Chess World Cup, and it was held in Baku, Azerbaijan. The tournament ran parallel to the women's world cup 2023.

                The time format for the world cup is 90 minutes per player with a 30 second increment, and 30 extra minutes on move 40, with the tiebreaks being rapid games of 25+10 and 10+10.
                The total prize fund is US$1,834,000, with the first prize of US$110,000 - A lot of money. It was a tournamet of upsets, with the real main star being the 18 year old indian prodigy
                pragg, who beat the likes of MVL, Duda, and even big names like Hikaru and Fabiano caruana, before ultimately losing the finals to magnus. The 3rd place match was won by fabiano caruana,
                beating Nijat abasov. Normally, Nijat abasov would not qualify for the candidates tournament, but since magnus won and withdrew from the candidates, he qualifies.
                Even as far in to the tournament as the round of 8, there were <i>4</i> Indian prodigies - out of a total 206 players. The 4 were praggnandha, Nihal sarin, Gukesh D, and Arjun Erigaisi.

                with a score of 2.5 to 1.5. Both players showed exceptional skill, and despite ultimately losing, Pragg was showered with praise as he returned to the chennai airport, with a huge crowd of people waiting for him.
