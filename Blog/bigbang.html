            <h2>The Big Bang and more, "Briefly"</h2>
            <p><i>Disclaimer: This page is incomplete and likely will be for a while.</i></p>
            <p>The Big Bang is something we all have heard of. We all know that it was the event that caused the formation of the universe,
                but there is a lot more to it than just that; Have you ever heard of cosmic inflation? Baryogenesis? Why the
                bang theory is widely accepted to this day unlife the likes of its rivals like the steady state theory? That is what this 
                article is about. <br></p>

                an image showing the timeline of the universe from the Big Bang. As you can see, the universe rapidly expanded in size in 
                the first seconds of its existence. <br> <br>
            </p>
            <p> With that Introduction out of the way, let's dive in to it. First off, lets make it clear what exactly the Big Bang is. 
                You may think that it is an explosion in space, but that's not the case: matter does not appear out of nowhere and fill an 
                empty universe, space itself expands and increases the distance between two objects.
                The Big Bang Theory describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.
                It is the most widely accepted theory on the formation of the universe as it explains the evolution of the 
                observable universe from very early on from its creation.
            </p>
            <p>It is popular as it explains a lot of observed phenomena: The abundance of light elements (like hydrogen and helium), 
                the <b>Cosmic microwave background radiation</b> <!--Note: add a new page about the CMB-->and large scale structure are some examples. 
                critically, it agrees with the <b>Hubble-Lemaître law</b>, which is the observation that galaxies are moving away from Earth, 
                and the further away they are, the faster they are receding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Big Bang theory depends on two assumptions to work: The universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. 
                The universality of physical laws is one of the crucial principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle 
                states that the universe, on large scales, appears the same in all directions no matter what the location is. 
                And we know these assumptions are most likely true: General Relativity has passed many difficult 
                tests over the years, And since the universe appears the same in all directions from Earth, The universe may indeed appear the same in
                all directions, if the Copernican principle (which states that the earth does not have a special view of the universe) is true.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to the expansion of space, general relativity describes spacetime by a "metric", which determines the distances
                that separate nearby "points", which are specified using a coordinate chart. The cosmological principle singles out the 
                Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric, which describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding universe.
                The metric contains a "scale factor" which describes how the universe's size changes with time. 
                it allows the creation of a coordinate system called comoving coordinates, where the grid expands with the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another important feature is Horizons.  Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, 
                there may be events in the past whose light has not yet had time to reach us. This places a limit on the most distant objects that can be observed. 
                Also, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by these objects will never reach us.

                Timeline Of The Early Universe
            </h3>
            <h4>
                Singularity - Where relativity breaks down
            </h4>    
            <p>
                Seeing the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity, we end up with infinite density and temperature
                at a point in the past. This gravitational singularity shows that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics 
                in these situations. A unified field theory unifying gravity with the other three fundamental forces would be needed to 
                describe these situations. Since the early universe did not immediately collapse into many black holes, 
                matter at that time must have been very evenly distributed with a very small density gradient.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Cosmic Inflation and baryogenesis - The universe grows
            </h4>
            <p>
                The early phases of the universe are subject to much speculation, as we have no observational data on it. Most theories
                say that the universe had a very high energy density, temperature and pressure, and was rapidly expanding and cooling. 
                The <b>planck epoch</b> (0 to 10^-43 seconds into the expansion of the universe) was a time when the four fundamental 
                forces of the universe - Electromagnetism, The strong and weak nuclear forces, and gravity - were unified as one. The size of the 
                universe at this time was roughly 10^-35 metres, a <b>planck length</b>, and had a temperature of 10^32 degrees Celsius. The conditions
                were so extreme at the time that even the concept of a particle breaks down. A theory of <b>quantum gravity</b> will be needed to explain 
                this period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                at 10^-43 seconds, the <b>grand unification epoch</b> began, with the force of gravity separating from the other forces as the universe's
                temperature fell. at around 10^-37 seconds, a phase transition (A transition between the states of matter) caused <b>cosmic inflation</b>
                , where the size of the universe grew exponentially, not stopped by the speed of light, and temperatures dropped by a factor or 100,000.
                Tiny quantum fluctuations caused by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which says that the more accurately you measure the 
                position of a particle, the less accurate its momentum will be, were amplified and would eventually form the large scale structures of the 
                universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                at around 10^-36 seconds, the strong nuclear force separated from the other forces, and inflation stopped at around 10^-32 seconds,
                with the universe having increased in size by a factor of at least 10^78. The universe reheated till elementary particles like <b>quark-gluon 
                plasma</b> could be produced, and particle-antiparticle pairs were constantly being produced and destroyed. many exotic particles like 
                <b>W±</b> and <b>Z bosons</b> were formed at this time. At some point, an unknown reaction
                called <b>baryogenesis</b> caused all antimatter to be annihilated and left a very small excess of quarks and leptons - one in 30 million. This 
                is why we find no antimatter in the present day universe.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Cooling -  The universe starts to take its present shape
            </h4>
            <p>
                This is a period of the universe that is much less speculative, as particle energies drop to values that can be achieved in 
                particle accelerators. Phase transitions put the fundamental forces into their present forms, with the electromagnetic force
                and the weak nuclear force separating at 10^-12 seconds. at 10^-6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons like
                protons and neutrons. The temeperature was no longer high enough to create particle-antiparticle pairs. immediately after this,
                as mass annihilation occured, leaving just one in 10^8 particles and no antiparticles, with a similar process occuring at 1 second 
                for electrons and positrons. after this, the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons, with few neutrinos.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few minutes into the expansion of the universe, the temperature reached 1 billion kelvin and the density of the universe was
                comparable to the earth's atmosphere. neutrons combined with protons to deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called <b>Big Bang 
                nucleosynthesis.</b> most protons remained seperate as hydrogen nuclei. After around 379,000 years, electrons and atomic nuclei 
                combined to form atoms (mostly hydrogen), which were able to emit radiation. this radiation can still be detected to this day and 
                is known as the <b>Cosmic microwave background</b>.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Structure formation - Galaxies and stars form
            </h4>
            <p>
                Some parts of the universe were slightly denser than the rest. these parts attracted more matter and grew even denser, eventually
                forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies and other structures we can observe today. The details depend on the type of matter and its amount 
                in the universe, since we know so little about dark matter.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Cosmic acceleration - The universe is speeding up
            </h4>
            <p>
                Observations of the Cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae imply that 73% of the universe's total energy density is in 
                the form of dark energy, a mysterious form of energy. It likely existed in the early universe, but since everything was closer together, 
                gravity dominated, slowing down expansion. But now, the declining density of matter relative to the density of dark energy is causing 
                the universe to begin to accelerate. Dark energy takes the form of the <b>cosmological constant</b> (which is vacuum energy, an underlying energy
                that exists throughout the universe.) in Einstein Field equations of general relativity, but the details of its relationship
                with the standard model of particle physics continues to be investigated in observation and theory. Understanding this earliest of 
                eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.
