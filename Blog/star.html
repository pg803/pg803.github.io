                    So, What is the closest star? Most people might say Alpha Centauri, Without realizing the problem
                    in that answer. (And to all the people saying the Sun, You're not wrong, But where's the fun?)<br>
                    And to an extent, this is indeed the correct answer*.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our stellar neighbours have a surprising lot in common with our sun, and yet are so different. 
                    The Alpha Centauri <u>System</u> consists of <b>Three different stars</b>, unlike our solar system with only one.
                    The system consists of two sun-stars Alpha Centauri A and Alpha centauri B (With the nice names of <b>Rigil Kentaurus and Toliman</b> respectively)
                    With a small, red dwarf star (Alpha Centarui C) orbiting around both, Called <b><u>Proxima</u> Centauri</b>.

                <h3>Alpha centauri A and B</h3>
                <p>
                    And these two larger stars are <i>really</i> similar to the sun, at 1.1 and 0.9 Solar masses. The two larger stars 
                    are close enough that they appear to the naked eye as a single star, becoming the third brightest star in the night sky 
                    <i>(The two stars are as close as saturn is to the sun!)</i>.
                    Also, because they are so similar and are close enough, Both stars form a <b>binary system</b>, and the stars
                    orbit a <b><i>Barycentre</i></b>, A common point in space. (<b>Side note:</b> Our solar system can actually be considered a binary system.
                    Jupiter is massive enough to make the sun 'wobble' a bit, and when jupiter and saturn are on the same side of the sun, the 
                    solar system's barycentre moves from inside the sun to outside.)

                <h3>Proxima Centauri</h3>
                <p>Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf star so faint its not visible to the naked eye. The small star orbits around the two larger stars
                    at a distance of 0.21 Light years away, far enough that it is actually the <b><i>Closest star to the sun,</i></b> at 4.24 Light years.
                </p>
                <h4>The planets of the system</h4>
                <p>
                    Only the small proxima centauri has any confirmed planets around it, Proxima B - an earth sized planet in the habitable zone- and Proxima D - A candidate Sub-Earth.
                    (If you're thinking about Proxima C, a Mini-neptune,  Its existance is controversial.)
