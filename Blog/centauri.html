                    Our stellar neighbours have a surprising lot in common with our sun, and yet are so different. 
                    The Alpha Centauri <u>System</u> consists of <b>Three different stars</b>, unlike our solar system with only one.
                    The system consists of two sun-like stars Alpha Centauri A and Alpha centauri B (With the nice names of <b>Rigil Kentaurus and Toliman</b> respectively)
                    With a small, red dwarf star (Alpha Centarui C) orbiting around both, Called <b><u>Proxima</u> Centauri</b>.

                <h3>Alpha centauri A and B</h3>
                <p>
                    And these two larger stars are <i>really</i> similar to the sun, at 1.1 and 0.9 Solar masses. The two larger stars 
                    are close enough that they appear to the naked eye as a single star, becoming the third brightest star in the night sky 
                    <i>(The two stars are as close to each other as saturn is to the sun!)</i>.
                    Also, because they are so similar and are close enough, Both stars form a <b>binary system</b>, where the stars
                    orbit a <b><i>Barycentre</i></b>, A common point in space. (<b>Side note:</b> Our solar system can actually be considered a binary system.
                    Jupiter is massive enough to make the sun 'wobble' a bit, and when jupiter and saturn are on the same side of the sun, the 
                    solar system's barycentre moves from inside the sun to outside.)

                <h3>Proxima Centauri</h3>
                <p>Proxima Centauri is a small red dwarf star so faint its not visible to the naked eye. The small star orbits around the two larger stars
                    at a distance of 0.21 Light years away, far enough that it is actually the <b><i>Closest star to the sun,</i></b> at 4.24 Light years.

                <h4>The planets of the system</h4>
                <p>
                    Only the small proxima centauri has any confirmed planets around it, Proxima B - an earth sized planet in the habitable zone- and Proxima D - A candidate Sub-Earth.
                </p>
                <h4>The controveries of the planets</h4>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Proxima_planetary_system_new.jpg/800px-Proxima_planetary_system_new.jpg" alt="Proxima centauri system">
                </figure>
                <p>Including all the controveries, The three stars combined have 5 planets, with three orbiting the small proxima centauri.</p>
                <p>There's an unconfirmed planet (C1, Or candidate 1) around the largest star in the system, and while we don't have any details, its year is almost as long
                    as ours(if it exists - it could just be some dust). When it comes to the other star, there's a planet that was confirmed, but later disproven. On top of this,
                    another planet was theorized based on a <b>transit event, </b> Where the star suddenly dimmed and re-brightened, but a planet would cause regular dimmings,
                    and another dimming event was not observed.
                </p>
                <p>When it comes to <u>Proxima C</u>, it is thought to orbit only slightly further out than earth, but one year would still be 1,900 days long. 
                    Its about 7 times more massive than Earth, and it could have a huge ring system like saturn. Another paper disputes its existence though.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, there very well be more planets waiting to be discovered. Current estimates place the probability of finding an Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri at <b><i>75%</i></b>.
                    There also may exist planets orbiting around both stars as a whole, far from the stars themselves - Like the theorized planet 9. Given how similar the system is to ours,
                    It is highly likely for more similarities to be uncovered soon.
