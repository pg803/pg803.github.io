        <p>Space travel is a field of science loved by science fiction writers, describing a world 
            where humans overcome their problems to become a thriving interplanetary, or interstellar species.
            But can space flight actually help humans acheive this utopian future?
        </p>
        <h3>The pros of space travel</h3>
        <h4>It helps in the advancement of science</h4>
        <p>
            The studies we conduct in space massively impact our lifes on the ground, and we developed many 
            technologies that have massive roles in our lives due to space travel, such as Artificial limbs,
            phone cameras, LEDs, memory foam, and even the PC. The innovation required to get to the stars 
            makes our life on Earth better.
        </p>
        <h4>It gives us access to tons of raw material</h4>
        <p>Not only does space travel help create groundbreaking products, it could also help make them.
            Things like asteroid mining can be an absolute game changer for the advancement of the human race.
            Also, Finding despotits of useful materials on other plants can be very useful in the future,
            when humans expand out from Earth and settle on other planets.
        </p>
        <h4>It helps preserve our species</h4>
        <p>There are a plethora of threats in the universe on our small planet, and only staying on this small rock
            will eventually be the end of our race. Exploring space not only helps us locate threats and prepare for them,
            it also helps preserve our species by not putting all our eggs in one basket: if Earth is anhialated, humans 
            as a species still exist.
        </p>
        <h4>It helps unite nations</h4>
        <p>Out of the 72 nations that currently have a space program, only 3 have a government space agency - China, 
            Russia and the United states -  and 14 with basic launch capability (Adding europe, India and japan). 
            The remaining nations need to work together with these nations to go to space due to the costs involved and 
            the resources needed to acheive space flight. This is one of the places humans of all nations can work together,
            without much conflict.
        </p>
        <h4>it improves life back on Earth</h4>
        <p>Space travel creates thousands of jobs all across the world. 
            People from all walks of life contribute to space exploration every day, ranging from astronomers to 
            actual rocket scientists. These opportunities allows us to explore many different fields of study
        </p>
        <h3>The cons of space travel</h3>
        <h4>Getting into space can be dangerous</h4>
        <p>While space travel has become much safer over the past decades, it is still a rather risky project
             and the chances for accidents are still present. Astronauts still have to get in to the rocket 
            knowing that they might not come back home. there have been over 20 individuals who lost their 
            lives in the line of duty while advancing U.S. space program interests.</p>
        <h4>Space travel takes a lot of time</h4>
        <p>Most space missions are long-term, taking months,years or even decades to complete. Few deliver immediate
            results and most are considered long term projects.
        </p>
        <h4>Space missions are often very expensive</h4>
        <p>When the space shuttle program was active in the US, A single launch cost around $500 million, not including
            the expenses of postponment that often occured. manned missions could cost about 10 times that amount, and
            seeing that space missions are long term, spending so much money for such a late return is a questionable
            descision.
        </p>
        <h4>Our technology is not advanced enough</h4>
