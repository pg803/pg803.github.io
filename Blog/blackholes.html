            When thinking of the future of the universe, Many people imagine a desolate landscape of cold, dead stars - Devoid of any other features. 
            And while that may be true for most stars, the future of black holes is far more interesting. Black holes won't be around forever as the 
            vaccum cleaners of the universe - they too, will die. And unlike any other star, Black holes don't die with a bang - They die with a wimper.

            To understand how this happens, we have to start with Stephen hawking, a cosmologist and Theoretical physicist who died in 2018. He was regarded
            as a genius in his field, and was the first to propose a theory of how black holes die. In 1974, He was combining Einstein's theory of relativity 
            with quantum mechanics to describe the 'temperature' of a black hole, at a time when it was thought black holes cannot emit anything.
            Hawking showed that black holes can emit radiation in the X-ray to gamma-ray range of the spectrum, which went on to be called 'Hawking radiation'.
