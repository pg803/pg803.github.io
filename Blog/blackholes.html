            When thinking of the future of the universe, Many people imagine a desolate landscape of cold, dead stars - Devoid of any other features. 
            And while that may be true for most stars, the future of black holes is far more interesting. Black holes won't be around forever as the 
            vaccum cleaners of the universe - they too, will die. And unlike any other star, Black holes don't die with a bang - They die with a wimper.

            To understand how this happens, we have to start with Stephen hawking, a cosmologist and Theoretical physicist who died in 2018. He was regarded
            as a genius in his field, and was the first to propose a theory of how black holes die. In 1974, He was combining Einstein's theory of relativity 
            with quantum mechanics to describe the 'temperature' of a black hole, at a time when it was thought black holes cannot emit anything.
            Hawking showed that black holes can emit radiation in the X-ray to gamma-ray range of the spectrum, which went on to be called 'Hawking radiation'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hawking radiation is the thermal radiation predicted to be spontaneously emitted by black holes.
            To understand this, We first need to understand the concept of virtual particles. On the smallest scales of spacetimes, 
            so called 'quantum fluctuations' lead to pairs of particles - one with postitive energy and one with negative - that can spontaneously appear, drift apart, and collide back together and annihilate.
            . These particles are called virtual particles because they are not real particles, but rather fluctuations.
            Since they anhialate almost instantly, they cannot be observed directly, and the overall energy of the system is conserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in the presence of a black hole, one of the virtual particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes.
            Since the particle that escaped can longer anhialate itself, it is now 'real', with positive energy, and its mass can be said to come from the black hole.    
            This means that the black hole loses mass - Slowly, but surely (The rate of emission is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that smaller black holes radiate more intensely than larger ones.).
            The flow of particles of negative energy into the black hole reduces its mass until it disappears completely in a final burst of radiation.

        <p>This process is only possible because of the extremes of black holes. Normally, we think of positive energy as particles moving forward in time.
            However, in the extreme gravity near a black hole, 'forward in time' loses its meaning, allowing particles to 'borrow' energy from the black hole.

        <h3>The distant future of the Universe</h3>
        <p>
            As the universe continues to expand due the mysterious workings of dark energy, the current star filled age of the universe will come 
            to an end as the clouds of dust required to form stars spread apart. The last stars will die out in about 10<sup>14</sup> years. At this point, even 
            galaxies have fallen apart and flown away from each other. The universe is now a cold, dark place, with only black holes and the corpses of dead stars.
            And for a long time, the only sparks of light in a cold and dead universe will be the gobbling up of matter by black holes, eventually leaving nothing behind.
        </p>

        <p>While space time will occasianally be shook by the collisions of these behemoths, they too will eventually die out -  For a black hole of one solar mass, it would take about 10<sup>67</sup> years to evaporate completely.
            And when the last black holes die, the universe will be nothing but a desolate void of nothing but rougue photons, neutrinos, electrons, and positrons.
            All mass would decay, leaving quantum fluctuations the only events to unfold in the universe. And yet, this is how the universe will spend the 
            majority of its life - As a cold, dark, empty void, with an average temperature of absolute zero.
        </p>
        <p>
            This phase could last indefinitely, unless some new physical phenomena occur that could change the fate of the universe. 
            For example, some physicists have speculated that quantum fluctuations could create new regions of space with different physical laws,
            or that the vacuum energy could become unstable and cause a new Big Bang. However, these are highly speculative scenarios that have 
            no observational support. For all practical purposes, the Dark Era will be the end of the universe as we know it.
