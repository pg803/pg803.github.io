            When thinking of the future of the universe, Many people imagine a desolate landscape of cold, dead stars - Devoid of any other features. 
            And while that may be true for most stars, the future of black holes is far more interesting. Black holes won't be around forever as the 
            vaccum cleaners of the universe - they too, will die. And unlike any other star, Black holes don't die with a bang - They die with a wimper.

            To understand how this happens, we have to start with Stephen hawking, a cosmologist and Theoretical physicist who died in 2018. He was regarded
            as a genius in his field, and was the first to propose a theory of how black holes die. In 1974, He was combining Einstein's theory of relativity 
            with quantum mechanics to describe the 'temperature' of a black hole, at a time when it was thought black holes cannot emit anything.
            Hawking showed that black holes can emit radiation in the X-ray to gamma-ray range of the spectrum, which went on to be called 'Hawking radiation'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hawking radiation is the thermal radiation predicted to be spontaneously emitted by black holes.
            To understand this, We first need to understand the concept of virtual particles. On the smallest scales of spacetimes, 
            so called 'quantum fluctuations' lead to pairs of particles - one with postitive energy and one with negative - that can spontaneously appear, drift apart, and collide back together and annihilate.
            . These particles are called virtual particles because they are not real particles, but rather fluctuations.
            Since they anhialate almost instantly, they cannot be observed directly, and the overall energy of the system is conserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in the presence of a black hole, one of the virtual particles can fall into the black hole, while the other escapes.
            Since the particle that escaped can longer anhialate itself, it is now 'real', with positive energy, and its mass can be said to come from the black hole.    
            This means that the black hole loses mass - Slowly, but surely (The rate of emission is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that smaller black holes radiate more intensely than larger ones.).
            The flow of particles of negative energy into the black hole reduces its mass until it disappears completely in a final burst of radiation.

        <p>This process is only possible because of the extremes of black holes. Normally, we think of positive energy as particles moving forward in time.
            However, in the extreme gravity near a black hole, 'forward in time' loses its meaning, allowing particles to 'borrow' energy from the black hole.
